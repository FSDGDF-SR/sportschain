# Digital Transaction Model for the Sports Industry Chain Based on Blockchain Technology

## Overview

This project introduces a blockchain-based digital transaction model designed for the sports industry. It addresses the limitations of traditional centralized systems by improving efficiency, security, transparency, and fairness in financial interactions among athletes, clubs, sponsors, and fans.

## Abstract

The rapid digital transformation of the sports industry has created significant opportunities, but traditional transaction models still face challenges such as centralized control, lack of trust, and inefficiencies in revenue distribution. These problems often arise due to reliance on intermediaries, leading to issues like data manipulation, high operational costs, and transaction delays.

To overcome these limitations, this project proposes a blockchain-based solution that uses smart contracts and distributed ledger technology (DLT). The model ensures:

- Decentralized and secure transactions
- Real-time verification
- Optimized revenue distribution
- Reduced risk of fraud
- Lower transaction costs

Through simulations and empirical analysis, the model demonstrates improved transaction speed, enhanced transparency, and greater financial inclusivity across the sports ecosystem.
